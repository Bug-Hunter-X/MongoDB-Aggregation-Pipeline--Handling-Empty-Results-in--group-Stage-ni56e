# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline: Handling Empty Results in $group Stage

This example demonstrates a potential issue in MongoDB aggregation pipelines when the `$group` stage receives no input documents.  The pipeline attempts to find the city with the highest average age of users over 25.  However, if no users are over 25, the pipeline silently returns an empty array, making it difficult to determine whether no users matched the criteria or there was an error.

## Bug:

The provided Javascript code uses an aggregation pipeline with `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, and `$limit` stages. The issue arises when the `$match` stage filters out all documents, leading to an empty input for the `$group` stage.  This results in an empty output without any indication of whether this is due to no matching documents or a pipeline error.

## Solution:

The solution involves adding a `$lookup` stage to check if any documents were found. If no matching documents are found in the collection, the query will explicitly report it.
